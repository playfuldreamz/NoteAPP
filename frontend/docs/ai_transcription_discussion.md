## Discussion

### Alex (Frontend):
"From the frontend perspective, we need to consider how to best integrate AI enhancement with the existing WebSpeech API. The WebSpeech API provides real-time transcription, but the accuracy can vary. We should implement a system where users can choose between raw and enhanced transcripts."

### Jordan (AI/ML):
"To improve transcription accuracy, we can implement a post-processing pipeline that uses a transformer-based model like Whisper or Wav2Vec 2.0. These models can correct common speech recognition errors and add punctuation. We should also consider implementing confidence scoring to help users understand the reliability of the transcription."

### Taylor (Backend):
"We'll need to design an efficient pipeline for processing the audio data. I suggest:
1. Frontend sends raw audio and initial transcription
2. Backend processes through AI enhancement
3. Results are cached for quick retrieval
4. Users can request re-processing if needed

We should implement rate limiting and queueing to handle high traffic."

### Alex:
"That makes sense. On the frontend, we can show both transcripts side-by-side with visual indicators for confidence levels. We should also provide settings for users to adjust the enhancement parameters."

### Jordan:
"We can implement multiple enhancement levels:
1. Basic: Just punctuation and capitalization
2. Advanced: Grammar correction and context-aware improvements
3. Expert: Full context rewriting with style adjustments

Each level would have different processing times and resource requirements."

### Taylor:
"From a backend perspective, we'll need to monitor:
- Processing times
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- User preferences

We should implement logging and analytics to track these metrics and optimize the system."

### Alex:
"Let's also consider the user interface for managing enhanced transcripts. We should provide:
- Side-by-side comparison view
- Confidence indicators
- Edit history
- Version control

This will help users make the most of the enhanced transcripts."

### Jordan:
"We should also consider implementing a feedback loop where users can correct transcripts, which we can use to improve our models over time."

### Taylor:
"Agreed. We'll need to implement a secure storage system for these corrections and a pipeline for retraining the models."

## Conclusion
The team agrees on implementing a multi-tier AI enhancement system that:
1. Preserves the original WebSpeech API output
2. Provides multiple levels of enhancement
3. Includes confidence scoring
4. Allows user feedback and corrections
5. Is scalable and efficient
